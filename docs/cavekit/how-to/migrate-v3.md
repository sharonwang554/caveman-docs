Honest answer: v4 is not a minor version of v3. It is a different shape
with the same name. This doc helps you decide whether to move, and if so,
how.

See also: [UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/cavekit/blob/main/UPGRADE.md) on GitHub for the latest migration notes.

## SHOULD YOU UPGRADE?

**Stay on v3.1.0 if**:
- Your project has a large `context/kits/` investment you actively iterate on
- You rely on the autonomous loop, parallel wave execution, or peer review
- Your team has shared muscle memory on `/ck:sketch → /ck:map → /ck:make`
- Your hooks / scripts integrate with the v3 state machine

**Move to v4 if**:
- You want fewer moving parts
- You find yourself fighting the framework more than you use it
- Token cost of invoking v3 commands outweighs the value
- You start a fresh project and want the distilled version

Either is a valid answer. v3.1.0 is not abandoned — it is frozen. Frozen
code does not rot as fast as it looks like it does.

## WHAT CHANGED

| v3.1.0 | v4.0.0 |
|---|---|
| 16 slash commands | 3 (`/ck:spec`, `/ck:build`, `/ck:check`) |
| 12 named sub-agents | 0 — main Claude does the work |
| 21 skills | 2 (`caveman`, `backprop`) |
| `context/kits/` directory | single `SPEC.md` at repo root |
| Hunt lifecycle (sketch/map/make/check) | flat spec → build → check |
| Go binary, shell hooks, TS picker | none |
| Autonomous loop with stop-hook | native Claude Code plan-then-execute |
| Design system, knowledge graph, Codex review | cut |
| Parallel wave execution | single-thread |
| Caveman opt-in for internal chatter | caveman default for spec writes |

### Full v3.1.0 command list (16 slash commands)

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/ck:sketch` | Draft initial design from a prompt |
| `/ck:map` | Break sketch into implementation tasks |
| `/ck:make` | Execute tasks from the map |
| `/ck:check` | Verify implementation against spec |
| `/ck:ship` | Final review and prepare for merge |
| `/ck:review` | Code review pass |
| `/ck:revise` | Apply review feedback |
| `/ck:status` | Show current Hunt phase and progress |
| `/ck:design` | Design system enforcement |
| `/ck:research` | Research a topic before building |
| `/ck:init` | Initialize cavekit in a project |
| `/ck:config` | Edit cavekit configuration |
| `/ck:resume` | Resume an interrupted Hunt |
| `/ck:help` | Show command reference |
| `/ck:team` | Team mode (parallel agents) |
| `/ck:make-parallel` | Parallel wave execution |

These commands orchestrated **12 named sub-agents** with per-task token budgets, stop-hook state machine, model-tier routing, auto-backpropagation from test failures, tool-result caching, and Karpathy behavioral guardrails.

## MIGRATION PATH

There is no automated migrator. The v3 `kits/` structure does not map
cleanly to `SPEC.md` — the point of v4 is that caveman + pipe tables
replace that tree. A script would produce lossy nonsense.

**Recommended path** for an in-flight v3 project that has working code:

1. Check out a fresh branch off your current v3 branch: `git checkout -b v4-migration`.
2. Install cavekit v4 (the default branch, or plugin `v4.0.0`).
3. Run `/ck:spec from-code`. v4 will walk your built code and produce
   a `SPEC.md`. **The code is the source of truth**, not your old kits.
4. Review the generated spec. Amend with `/ck:spec amend §X`.
5. Your old `context/kits/` stays in git history. If you ever need the
   original reasoning, `git log -- context/kits/`.
6. Delete the old directory on the v4-migration branch once you trust
   the spec. Commit. Merge when ready.

**If you have not built anything yet** (still in sketch phase): you have
the easiest migration. Scrap the kit, start with `/ck:spec <your idea>`.

## WHAT YOU LOSE

- **Autonomous loop**: v4 has no stop-hook state machine. Each
  `/ck:build` invocation is one plan-then-execute. If you liked "leave
  it running for an hour," v4 does not do that. Use a shell loop or stay
  on v3.
- **Parallel execution**: v4 is deliberately single-thread. Big projects
  take linear wall-clock time. This was a considered trade.
- **Peer review via Codex**: cut. If you want a second model on a diff,
  run it manually or install a peer-review skill separately.
- **Design system, knowledge graph, team mode**: cut. Separate tools if
  you need them.
- **Dashboards**: cut. `cat SPEC.md | grep §T` replaces them.

## WHAT YOU GAIN

- Drastically smaller context footprint on every invocation
- A spec you can read in 30 seconds
- No more "which agent should I invoke?"
- No more orphaned state files
- Backprop as a reflex in every build, not an opt-in

## v3 REACHABILITY

v3.1.0 is frozen at its tag. Always installable:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="marketplace" label="Marketplace" default>

  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add juliusbrussee/cavekit@v3.1.0
  /plugin install ck@cavekit
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="git" label="Git Clone">

  ```bash
  git clone -b v3.1.0 https://github.com/juliusbrussee/cavekit.git
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


No v3 code is destroyed — `git log v3.1.0` shows every commit. v3
documentation stays at that tag.

## ONE-WAY DOOR?

No. It is a **two-way door** — `SPEC.md` is plain markdown; nothing traps you in either direction.

:::tip[Honest framing]
- **Stay on v3.1.0** if your project has active `context/kits/` investment.
- **Move to v4** if you want fewer moving parts and smaller token bills.
:::

You can switch back. `SPEC.md` does not lock you in — re-export it into `context/kits/*.md` if you decide v3 was right for your project. The work is not trapped.

## QUESTIONS

Open an issue on GitHub. Label `v3` for v3 bugs (fixes only for critical
issues), `v4` for v4 questions.
